        <article>
        <p>Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, film director, composer, and producer. After achieving success in the Western TV series Rawhide, he rose to international fame with his role as the "Man with No Name" in Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone's "Dollars Trilogy" of Spaghetti Westerns during the mid-1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.[23][24] His accolades include four Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, three César Awards, and an AFI Life Achievement Award.</p>
        <p>An Academy Award nominee for Best Actor, Eastwood won Best Director and Best Picture for his Western film Unforgiven (1992) and his sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004). His greatest commercial successes are the adventure comedy Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and its action comedy sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980).[25] Other popular Eastwood films include the Westerns Hang 'Em High (1968) and Pale Rider (1985), the prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979), the war film Heartbreak Ridge (1986), the action film In the Line of Fire (1993), and the romantic drama The Bridges of Madison County (1995). More recent works are Gran Torino (2008), The Mule (2018), and the upcoming film Cry Macho (2021). Since 1967, Eastwood's company Malpaso Productions has produced all but four of his American films.</p>

        <p>In 2010 at age 80, Eastwood spent approximately $20 million[326] to build himself a 15,949-square-foot compound in Carmel-by-the-Sea.[327][328] His California real estate portfolio also includes a 6,136-square-foot Spanish style mansion in Bel-Air,[329][330] the 1,067.5 acre Rising River Ranch in Burney,[331] an apartment in Burbank,[332] as well as a large but understated[333] house located next door to his longtime primary Bel-Air residence.[334][335] Eastwood is known to have purchased property in two other states. He owns a 5,700-square-foot house in Sun Valley, Idaho[336][337] and a 1.13-acre, oceanfront manor in Kihei, Hawaii.[338][339][340] The latter was featured in an episode of the 2012 reality show Mrs. Eastwood & Company.[341]

        <p>Eastwood has held a lifelong distaste for tobacco and tobacco companies, and smokes only when required to do so by a film role. He has also been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthy eating and daily Transcendental Meditation.[344][345][346]

            He opened an old English-inspired pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in Carmel in 1971.[347] Eastwood sold the pub in 1999 and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea.[348][349]
